# credit-risk-classification
I would like to give my thanks to TA Drew for his guidance through his speedruns.

Most of the code for the Credit Risk Analysis can be found in the jupyter notebook (credit_risk_classification.ipynb).

The analysis can be found in a markdown file (report.md).

You are currently in the readme file, which acts as a directory for this repository.
